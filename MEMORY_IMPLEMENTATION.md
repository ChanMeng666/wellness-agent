# Memory System Implementation

This document explains how we implemented the robust memory system for the Wellness Agent project to enable personalized, continuous experiences for users.

## Overview

The memory system allows the wellness agent to maintain context and personalize interactions across sessions. The implementation follows these key principles:

1. **Privacy-preserving**: Memory respects user privacy preferences
2. **Role-specific**: Different memory capabilities for employees, HR managers, and employers
3. **Persistent**: Information is maintained between sessions
4. **Contextual**: Memory enhances conversational context and reduces repetition
5. **Personalized**: Memory enables tailored recommendations based on user history

## Core Components

### Memory Functions

We implemented five core memory functions:

1. `memorize(key, value)`: Store a single key-value pair
2. `memorize_list(key, value)`: Add an item to a list stored under a key
3. `forget(key, value)`: Remove a value from a list
4. `get_memory(key)`: Retrieve stored information
5. `clear_memory_key(key)`: Remove an entire category of information

### User Profiles

Default profiles for each user role enable faster onboarding and consistent experience:

- `employee_default.json`: Default profile for employee users
- `hr_default.json`: Default profile for HR manager users
- `employer_default.json`: Default profile for employer/executive users

These profiles provide initial state and preferences based on the user's role.

### Session Management

Sessions maintain state between conversations, implemented in:

- `memory_service.py`: Handles session persistence and retrieval
- `server.py`: Enhanced with profile loading for new sessions
- Memory callbacks for automatic profile loading

## Integration with Sub-Agents

All sub-agents were enhanced to use memory capabilities:

### Employee Support Agent

- Remembers wellness preferences and communication style
- Tracks symptom history for improved pattern recognition
- Stores accommodation preferences for consistent support

### HR Manager Agent

- Maintains organizational structure and policy history
- Remembers anonymized accommodation patterns
- Preserves policy decisions and rationales

### Employer Insights Agent

- Tracks ROI metrics over time for trend analysis
- Remembers strategic priorities for consistent reporting
- Maintains anonymous organizational wellness trends

### Leave Requests Agent

- Remembers preferred request formats
- Stores privacy preferences for leave management
- Maintains history of accommodations that worked well

## Memory Architecture

The memory system is implemented with a tiered architecture:

1. **Memory Functions**: Core API accessible to the agents
2. **Session State**: In-memory storage during conversations
3. **Persistent Storage**: Database storage between sessions
4. **Default Profiles**: Initial state templates for new users

## User Experience Enhancements

Memory enables several key user experience improvements:

1. **Continuity**: Conversations maintain context across sessions
2. **Personalization**: Recommendations improve based on user history
3. **Efficiency**: Reduced need to repeat preferences or history
4. **Learning**: The system learns what works for each user over time
5. **Consistency**: Policies and preferences are applied consistently

## Privacy Considerations

The memory system was designed with privacy as a core principle:

1. Users control what information is remembered
2. Privacy settings are themselves remembered
3. HR and employer roles only access anonymized data
4. Role-based access controls apply to memory
5. Clear functions allow removal of stored information

## Future Enhancements

The memory system sets a foundation for future improvements:

1. Implementing differential privacy algorithms for aggregated data
2. Adding more structured memory types (episodic, semantic, procedural)
3. Enhancing pattern recognition with machine learning
4. Adding explicit user controls for memory management
5. Implementing memory visualization tools for transparency
