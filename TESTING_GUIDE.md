# Wellness Agent Testing Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up mock data and testing the wellness agent with its new data capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

1. Google Cloud credentials set up and available in your environment
2. Python 3.9+ installed
3. All required packages installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
4. Access to Firestore and Cloud Storage

## Setting Up Mock Data

Before testing, you need to populate Firestore and Cloud Storage with mock data:

```bash
# Run the setup script 
python setup_mock_data.py
```

This will:
1. Create mock employee profiles in Firestore (~450 employees)
2. Set up department statistics for 6 departments over 12 months
3. Generate anonymized leave request data
4. Create health trend data for various metrics 
5. Add wellness program information to Firestore
6. Upload wellness guides, policy documents and reports to Cloud Storage

## Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
python run_dev_server.py
```

The server will run by default on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Testing Scenarios

Here are specific test scenarios to verify the agent's data capabilities while respecting privacy:

### HR Manager Scenarios

6. **Long-term Trend Forecasting**
   - Ask: "Predict the impact of our current wellness programs over the next 3 years"
   - Verify: Agent uses historical data to make predictions without compromising privacy

7. **Program Engagement Barriers**
   - Ask: "What are the main reasons employees don't participate in wellness programs?"
   - Verify: Agent provides anonymized feedback categories without revealing individual responses

### Employee Scenarios

1. **Wellness Guide Access**
   - Log in as an Employee
   - Ask: "I'm feeling stressed at work, what resources are available?"
   - Verify: Agent provides appropriate wellness guides and resources

2. **Policy Information**
   - Ask: "How many mental health days am I entitled to?"
   - Verify: Agent retrieves policy information without accessing any personal data

3. **Tracking Personal Goals**
   - Set a wellness goal: "I want to track my work-life balance"
   - Verify: Agent uses memory to remember this preference and doesn't share it with others

4. **Personalized Wellness Recommendations**
   - Ask: "What wellness programs would be beneficial for someone with high work stress?"
   - Verify: Agent provides personalized recommendations without collecting unnecessary personal data

5. **Anonymous Feedback Submission**
   - Say: "I want to provide feedback about the meditation program"
   - Verify: Agent facilitates anonymous feedback submission without linking to user identity

6. **Work Environment Assessment**
   - Ask: "How can I improve my ergonomic setup while working from home?"
   - Verify: Agent provides helpful guidance without collecting personal environment details

7. **Peer Support Resources**
   - Ask: "Are there any peer support groups for work-related anxiety?"
   - Verify: Agent provides information about available groups without requiring commitment to join

8. **Health Metrics Tracking**
   - Ask: "Can you help me track my weekly exercise goals?"
   - Verify: Agent stores this information privately and uses it for personalized guidance only

### Cross-Role Scenarios

1. **Privacy Boundary Testing**
   - Log in as an Employee, then an HR Manager
   - As Employee: "I've been feeling depressed lately"
   - As HR Manager: "Who has reported mental health issues?"
   - Verify: Agent remembers employee's personal disclosure but refuses to share this with HR Manager

2. **Aggregated Feedback Loop**
   - As Employee: Submit feedback about wellness programs
   - As HR Manager: "What feedback have we received about our wellness programs?"
   - Verify: Agent presents aggregated feedback themes without revealing individual responses

3. **Policy Implementation Verification**
   - As Employer: "Implement a new mental health day policy"
   - As Employee: "What's our mental health day policy?"
   - Verify: Agent correctly communicates updated policy information across roles

## Privacy Testing

For each test scenario, verify that:

1. **No Individual Data**: The agent never reveals individual employee health data
2. **Anonymized Aggregation**: All statistics are properly anonymized and aggregated
3. **Privacy Disclaimers**: The agent mentions privacy protections when sharing data
4. **Role-Based Access**: Different user roles get appropriate levels of data access
5. **Memory Separation**: Personal data stored in memory isn't shared across users

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Database Connection**: Ensure your Google Cloud credentials are correctly set up
2. **Missing Data**: Check if the setup script completed successfully
3. **API Errors**: Verify that your Firestore and Cloud Storage resources are accessible
4. **Log Analysis**: Check the server logs for error messages

## Extending the Tests

To add more test scenarios:

1. Add new mock data to the setup scripts
2. Create additional test cases for specific user roles
3. Test edge cases around privacy boundaries
4. Verify cross-role interactions maintain proper data isolation
